#todo

I have kept some future modification in this existing application.

1) we can implement redirect feature from the tiny url to long original url.
2) we can provide the facility where client itself provide custom short url and we can also store user information.
3) Since I have assumed that there will be 100:1 ratio between read/write, So we can implement caching system which will improve performance by 100 times.
4) we can use AWS RDS for our database requirement which limit our effort regarding scaling and maintaining the database. It will also help to make deployment easy process.
